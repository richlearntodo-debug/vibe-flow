# Changelog

## 1.0.1 - 2026-08-24

- Reworked the Chinese user guide around a beginner-first five-step setup, with
  provider-specific instructions for WeChat Input Method, Typeless, Windows
  Voice Typing, Voquill, and configurable global-hotkey clients.
- Added a symptom-to-repair troubleshooting matrix covering installation,
  VB-CABLE endpoints, Bluetooth pairing, provider startup, missing text, delay,
  quiet speech, stale versions, and unsupported RC003 physical buttons.
- Added a real expanded provider-selector screenshot and upgraded the shortcut
  page with a compact hardware-validated reference for Home, direction/volume,
  Function, and TV behavior.
- Extended deterministic screenshot capture and release validation to include
  all tutorial images in the installer and portable ZIP.
- Kept the validated schema 15 / voice state machine v11 pipeline unchanged:
  `1.0x`, clear speech processing, 180 ms drain, ordered audio delivery, and
  automatic reversible `CABLE Output` capture routing.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-08-24

- Promoted the hardware-validated v11 voice pipeline and schema 15 defaults to
  the first stable Windows release without changing its gain, routing, drain,
  packet ordering, or endpoint-recovery behavior.
- Polished the native interface with correctly rendered navigation icons, a
  clearer V1 release identity, refined status colors, and live signal feedback
  for connecting, listening, processing, completion, and error states.
- Added a per-user Windows installer with Start Menu integration, clean upgrade
  behavior, optional desktop shortcut, uninstaller, and preserved user config.
- Expanded the five-step first-run guide and Chinese tutorial, then refreshed
  the reusable 1280 x 840 screenshots used by GitHub and support documentation.
- Kept the portable ZIP for users who prefer a no-install distribution and added
  release checksums for both public artifacts.

## 0.4.0-alpha - 2026-08-24

- Pinned the verified v11 voice settings as a named, recoverable stable profile:
  `1.0x`, robust speech processing, 180 ms drain, `CABLE Input`, automatic
  default-capture routing, and provider-specific startup timing.
- Replaced the technical diagnostics view with a seven-part self-check covering
  packaged components, both VB-CABLE endpoints, profile drift, bridge services,
  RC003/ATVV readiness, provider shortcut setup, and the latest end-to-end
  dictation. Each warning or failure has a direct repair action.
- Added self-check results to the privacy-safe issue summary without collecting
  recognized text, audio payloads, Bluetooth addresses, or complete device paths.
- Added real RC003 button highlights to the overview remote and an interactive
  remote control map beside shortcut configuration.
- Clarified that VB-CABLE is the only required extra local driver and made a
  successful real-device dictation mandatory before first-run setup completes.
- Refined navigation, workspace texture, status hierarchy, button feedback, and
  success feedback for a release-ready desktop experience.
- Upgraded configuration to schema 15 while preserving existing provider and
  verified remote-button choices.

## 0.3.0-alpha - 2026-08-24

- Renamed the visible product to **言灵 · Vibe Flow Remote** while preserving
  executable names, package names, update behavior, and existing user settings.
- Replaced the dense first-run dialog with a five-step guide: transcription
  provider, VB-CABLE endpoints, RC003 connection, provider shortcut, and first
  real-device dictation.
- Added provider-specific guidance and recommended profiles for WeChat Input
  Method, Typeless, Windows Voice Typing, Voquill, and custom tools.
- Added recording, processing, completion, and error visual states plus a subtle
  completion/error sound that can be disabled in Settings.
- Added a Chinese session-health summary covering trigger latency, recording
  duration, signal level, BLE gaps, queue drops, virtual-microphone drain, and
  default-microphone restoration.
- Added one-click, privacy-safe problem-summary copying, log-folder access, and
  bounded local log rotation. Normal diagnostics never include audio or
  recognized text.
- Upgraded configuration to schema 14 without changing the validated v11 voice
  route or RC003 button mappings.

## 0.2.1-alpha - 2026-08-24

- Added automatic per-dictation routing from the user's Windows default
  microphone to `CABLE Output`, so clients configured for `default` consume the
  RC003 stream instead of an unrelated physical microphone.
- Restores the original Console, Multimedia, and Communications capture endpoints
  after audio drains, rolls back partial failures, and preserves a local recovery
  marker for restoration after an unexpected exit.
- Added generation ownership so an older transcription completion cannot restore
  the microphone while a newer recording is active.
- Upgraded configuration to schema 13 and enabled automatic routing for existing
  users without changing verified remote-button mappings.

## 0.2.0-alpha - 2026-08-24

- Added provider profiles for WeChat Input Method, Typeless, Windows Voice Typing,
  Voquill, and configurable hotkey-driven transcription clients.
- Changed WeChat startup to toolbar-first with a bounded shortcut fallback,
  removing the measured 1.2-second dead wait and large unrecoverable pre-roll.
- Replaced frame-wide peak limiting with robust speech-level estimation and
  per-sample limiting; added a transparent fixed-gain mode.
- Reduced the fixed 400 ms end tail to the configured 180 ms default and added
  `trigger_to_ready_ms`, queue depth, drain time, and before/after level metrics.
- Added provider selection, shortcut, toggle/hold mode, and audio processing to
  the main UI and first-run setup.
- Upgraded configuration to schema 12 while preserving existing user mappings.
- Prevented a new recording from waiting behind the previous WeChat result panel;
  superseded virtual-microphone audio is discarded instead of delivered late.
- Added an explicit, one-shot audio diagnostic that captures decoded 16 kHz PCM,
  processed PCM, and `CABLE Output` for the next session only (30-second cap).

Validation on the development machine:

- RC003 ordered decode and audio processing self-tests pass.
- Five-second `CABLE Input` WASAPI clock test: 5047 ms, zero drops, zero pending.
- WeChat toolbar panel trigger is verified.
- Typeless 2.3.1 `RightAlt` start/stop is verified. Its end-to-end `CABLE Output`
  route still requires confirmation after that microphone is selected in Typeless.
- Voquill requires installed-client end-to-end validation.
